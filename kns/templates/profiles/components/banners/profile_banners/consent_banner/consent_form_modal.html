          As a group leader, you play a crucial role in managing the consent forms for underage members in your group. The consent form feature in the application is specifically designed to ensure that all necessary permissions are obtained and tracked for these members. Below are the key aspects of the consent form that pertain to you as a group leader:
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-md font-semibold text-black mb-2">1. Consent Form Submission</h2>
          <ul class="text-gray-900 text-sm">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Who Submits:</strong> As a group leader, you are responsible for ensuring that the consent forms for underage members in your group are submitted through the application. The forms must be completed and submitted by the parent or legal guardian of the underage member.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>How to Submit:</strong> Download the consent form by clicking on the download button above, print the consent form and get it signed by a guardian of the under-age user, and finally visit their profile to submit the signed consent form.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-md font-semibold text-black mb-2">2. Status Tracking</h2>
          <ul class="text-gray-900 text-sm">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Monitoring Status:</strong> Once a consent form is submitted, you can monitor its status directly within the application. The status will show as "Pending" until it is reviewed by an admin or designated reviewer.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Approval Process:</strong> The status will change to "Approved" if the consent is granted or "Rejected" if there are issues with the form. It is important to follow up on the status to ensure that all necessary consents are in place.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-md font-semibold text-black mb-2">3. Review and Approval Process</h2>
          <ul class="text-gray-900 text-sm">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Admin Review:</strong> The consent forms are reviewed by admins or designated reviewers who will either approve or reject the form. You can access the status and details of the review directly from the underage memberâ€™s profile page.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Rejection Handling:</strong> If a consent form is rejected, a reason will be provided. It is your responsibility to address any issues and ensure that a corrected form is submitted.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-sm">
          <strong>Summary:</strong> The consent form feature is designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking permissions for underage members. As a group leader, it is your responsibility to ensure that all consent forms are properly submitted and monitored, and that any issues are promptly addressed. This ensures that the underage members in your group are fully protected and that all necessary legal requirements are met.
